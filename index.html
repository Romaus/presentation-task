						<aside class="notes">
								Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, 
								invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, 
								while working at CERN. 
								
								The Web was originally 
								conceived and developed to meet the demand for 
								automated information-sharing between scientists 
								in universities and institutes around the world.

								The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving
								technologies of computers, data networks and hypertext 
								into a powerful and easy to use global information system.

								Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web 
								in March 1989.
								The document described a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" 
								in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" 
								could be viewed by “browsers”.

								By the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had the first Web server and browser up 
								and running at CERN, demonstrating his ideas. He developed the code for 
								his Web server on a NeXT computer.

							<img height="650" src="./src/9001001_01-A5-at-72-dpi.jpg">
							<aside class="notes">
								Only a few users had access to a NeXT computer 
								platform on which the first browser ran, but development 
								soon started on a simpler, ‘line-mode’ browser, which could 
								run on any system.	
								In 1991, Berners-Lee released his WWW software. 
								It included the ‘line-mode’ browser, 
								Web server software and a library for developers. 
								In March 1991, the software became available to colleagues 
								using CERN computers. A few months later, in August 1991, 
								he announced the WWW software on Internet newsgroups and interest in 
								the project spread around the world.

							<h3>Going global</h3>
							<li>December 1991 - first Web server in the US</li>
							<li>Late 1993 - there were over 500 known web servers</li>
							<li>1994 was the “Year of the Web”</li>
							<li>By the end of 1994, the Web had 10 000 servers and 10 million users.</li>
							<aside class="notes">
								Thanks to the efforts of Paul Kunz and Louise Addis, 
								the first Web server in the US came online in December 1991.
								There were essentially only two kinds of browser.
								One was the original development version, which was sophisticated but available only on NeXT machines.
								The other was the ‘line-mode’ browser, which was easy to install and run on any platform but limited in power and user-friendliness.

								<h3>Open standards</h3>
								<li>In 1994 was founded the International World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li>
								<li>In April 1995, INRIA became the first European W3C host</li>
								<li>In September 2018, there were more than 400 member organisations from around the world.</li>
								<aside class="notes">
										An essential point was that the web should remain an open standard for all to use.
										In 1994, Berners-Lee left CERN to join MIT and 
										founded the International World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
										The European Commission turned to the French National Institute for 
										Research in Computer Science and Controls (INRIA), to take over CERN's role. 
										In April 1995, INRIA became the first European W3C host, followed by Keio University of Japan 
										(Shonan Fujisawa Campus) in Asia in 1996. In 2003, ERCIM (European Research Consortium in 
										Informatics and Mathematics) took over the role of European W3C Host from INRIA. In 2013, 
										W3C announced Beihang University as the fourth Host.

					<h2>HTML</h2>
					<section>What is HTML?</section>
					<section>Short for HyperText Markup Language, this language used to create documents on the World Wide Web.</section>
					<aside class="notes">
						HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.
						There are hundreds of tags used to format and layout the information in a Web page. 
						Tags are also used to specify hypertext links. 
						These allow Web developers to direct users to other Web pages with 
						only a click of the mouse on either an image or word.

					<section>History of HTML</section>
					<section>
						<li>A first attempt at extending HTML in 1995 - HTML 3.0</li>
						<li>HTML 3.2 was completed in 1997</li>
						<li>HTML4 reaching completion in 1998.</li>
						<li>XHTML 1.0 and which was completed in 2000</li>
						<li>In 2007 the W3C formed a working group on the development of the HTML5</li>
						<aside class="notes">
								For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a number of extensions
								With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue again.
								A first abortive attempt at extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 
								then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as HTML 3.2, 
								which was completed in 1997. HTML4 followed, reaching completion in 1998.
								At this time, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML.
								The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004.
								Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG.
								In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5, and in 2007 formed a working group chartered 
								to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML5 specification. 
								Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under the W3C copyright.

						<h2>CSS</h2>
						<section>What is CSS?</section>
						<section>Stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</section>
						<aside class="notes">
								Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. 
								They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of 
								Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
								CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. 
								Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, 
								commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. 
								Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, 
								it can be used by any page that references the CSS file.

						<section>History of CSS</section>
						<section>
							<img height="550" src="./src/CSS3_taxonomy_and_status-v2.png"> 
							<aside class="notes">
								The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS 
								level 1, published on December 17, 1996.
								The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.
								CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998.
								Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, 
								CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". 
								Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, 
								preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication 
								of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.
								Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses.
								Some modules have Candidate Recommendation (CR) status and are considered moderately stable. 
								At CR stage, implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.
